# This script initializes the Transifex client. It then uploads the source resource to the 
# Transifex project and downloads the translated resources into the build.

# Some things to note:
# - The .tx folder, if it exists, is deleted beforehand so that the 'tx init' does not need to 
#   prompt to overwrite it.
# - The .tx folder is generated each time, rather than saving the .tx/config file into version 
#   control, because a .transifexrc also needs to be generated using the username and password.
#   Since these credentials should not be in version control, the regeneration approach is used.
